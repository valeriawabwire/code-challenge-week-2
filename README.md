## Description
1.The first code is a function that takes a string and converts it to all uppercase or lowercase letters, depending on whether the current character is uppercase or lowercase.
2.The second code is a function that generates an array of numbers between two given numbers. The function uses a do-while loop to increment a counter (i) until it is less than the second given number (num2).
3.The third code is a function that takes an array as an argument and returns an array of prime numbers. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the array, starting from index 1.
