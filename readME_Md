//question 1
The  code is a function that takes a string and converts it to all uppercase or lowercase letters, depending on whether the current character is uppercase or lowercase.

The function starts by declaring a variable title and setting it to the string "The Quick Brown Fox".

Then, it uses the split method to split the string into an array of characters, and the join method to convert the array back to a string. This is done to demonstrate how to work with strings in JavaScript.

Next, the code uses a map method to iterate over each character in the string and apply a function to it. The function checks whether the current character is uppercase or lowercase, and if it is, it converts it to the opposite case.

Finally, the code uses the join method again to convert the array of characters back to a string, and stores the result in a variable called result.

The console.log statements at the end of the function are used to print the result of the conversion to the console.
//question 2
The  code is a function that generates an array of numbers between two given numbers. The function uses a do-while loop to increment a counter (i) until it is less than the second given number (num2).

The function starts by defining two variables, num1 and num2, which are used to specify the range of numbers to generate. The function then creates an empty array called Result to store the generated numbers.

The do-while loop starts by initializing i to num1 and then checking if i is less than num2. The loop body consists of incrementing i by 1 and then repeating the check. The loop continues until i is less than num2, at which point the loop exits.

Finally, the function returns the Result array.
// question3
The code is a function that takes an array as an argument and returns an array of prime numbers. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the array, starting from index 1.

The if statement checks if the current element is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If the element is prime, it is added to the primes array.

The function returns the primes array at the end.
